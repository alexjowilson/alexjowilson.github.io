    Governments
  </h1>
    <p class="wrapper paragraph1">
    The role of government in this new era of the Internet is a much more involved one than before. It’s main function is in ensuring its respective citizens' digital rights are as represented as possible. This can take on many different forms given each respective circumstance. For example, the emphasis for some governments might be dealing with inaccessibility to the Internet whereas for others, the focus might be on ensuring that people are free to voice their opinions. Creating stricter regulations on the powers of corporations was one of the first big steps taken in the direction of civilizing the unruly Internet, as it allowed for ideals to be upheld and created by powers representing the people rather than those representing their own financial gain.

    Corporations
  </h1>
    <p class="wrapper paragraph1">
      During the Internet's first rise to universality, corporations dominated the scene. Without hard restrictions or laws, businesses were able to mold the user experience to whatever they deemed most effective. Censorship, misinformation, and monopolies were some of the common traits of Internet based business during this time period. These issues grew with the usage of the web until the lines between political issues and technical policy became sufficiently blurred to go beyond distinction. When the most prominent social media platform is justified to remove content disliked by a majority, how does the minority become heard? It became quickly clear that a restructuring of powers, policy, and infrastructure was desperately needed. We see now today how businesses use their policy of open discussion as a selling point, despite its mandatory nature. There is no longer the ambiguity of whether a company’s policies are the final word on regulating its own service; a sufficiently large enough platform can no longer hide behind a front of being just a financial machine and must instead accept its function as a political platform.

      The role of the IETF has historically been as purely what its name suggests: an engineering task force. Despite the numerous calls to ethical action from various groups, through ambivalence and political gridlock, the IETF had very little in embedding qualities of Digital Dignity into the structure of the Internet. One of the most important changes in recent years that has allowed for the regulation of the Internet has been eliminating such factors. As it stands, IETF is the biggest proponent of the way the Internet is today. In targeting the issue of motivation towards ethical efforts, the UN was responsible for setting up the system where each country presents a proportional number of engineers to represent their nations values and build an Internet with the ideals described by the Articles of Digital Dignity. This allowed for the creation of an Internet where people’s rights can be represented and upheld without a need for universal policing. Instead, policy and technical infrastructure are able to tackle the heavy lifting, leaving a minimal amount of work for governments to handle.
